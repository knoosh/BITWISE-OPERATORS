# BITWISE-OPERATORS
BITWISE

1. and The bitwise operator for AND logic is performed on two integers, keyed in by the user. The output is displayed.

2. counter This program seeks an integer from the user. Using the AND operation and right shift, each digit in the binary form of the integer is checked. The output returned is the number of 1s in the binary form of the integer.

3. even or odd The AND logic is employed with if-else conditions to determine if an integer is even or odd. The integer is even if number&1 returns 0, and odd otherwise.

4. switch case Switch case makes a menu that asks user which bit-wise operation they are interested in using. The program carries out AND, OR or XOR operation on two integers of the user's choice. Each case of the switch case function is assigned to an operation. The result is displayed to the user.
